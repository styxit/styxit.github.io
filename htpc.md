# HTPC Manager

> Htpc Manager combines all your favorite software into one slick interface


I am developing [Htpc Manager](http://htpc.io) and maintaining the [Github repo](https://github.com/styxit/HTPC-Manager). This software helps you controll all your software on you HTPC. It provides a nice web interface, wrapping all applications in one frontend.

It is written in Python and uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for templating.
