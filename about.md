# About me - Styxit

![Styxit personal](https://en.gravatar.com/avatar/91adfbdc92f75b09460b9600674dd663?s=200){: .pull-right}
My name is Floris, online known as Styxit. I live in the Netherlands. I like [coding](https://github.com/styxit), playing [games](http://psnprofiles.com/styxit) and ejnoy rock- and metal related [music](http://www.last.fm/user/twenty-2-choke).

I am a big fan of [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) and have used it for most of the websites i created. For this blog i wanted something new and went with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Code

Since 2013 i am working on [HTPC-Manager](http://htpc.io), an opensource project wich provides a frontend for all sorts of htpc-related software. It is mostly written in python and relies upon the available API's from the supported third party software. Python is not my main language, but i adopted it pretty quick. I may not yet use all of it's fancy capabilities, but i can find my way around.

I am currently employed at [Exonet](http://www.exonet.nl), a Dutch hosting provider. In the past i worked at several companies, all involved in or in some way related to webdevelopment. Besides that i ran my own webdevelopment and consultancy business.
